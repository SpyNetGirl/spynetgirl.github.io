This allows the installation of the app while ensuring the base policy automatically reverts to Enforced mode immediately afterward.</p> <p>During Audit mode, AppControl Manager captures all relevant Code Integrity and AppLocker events, analyzes them, and presents detailed insights in an organized view. You can also navigate to the specific folder path(s) where the application was installed, enabling the app to scan and display the contents on a separate page.</p> <p>The compiled data, scanned files and recorded events, are presented to you for review, filter, sort, and manage. Once you're satisfied, you can seamlessly convert these into a single Supplemental policy ready for deployment.</p> <p>While much of the process is automated, you remain in full control. With just a few clicks, you can fine-tune and manage your App Control policy efficiently.</p> <p>Rest assured, no unauthorized software or malware can make its way into your Supplemental policy. Every file and event is accompanied by highly detailed information, eliminating any guesswork and ensuring only trusted elements are included.</p> <p>If something like a power outage occurs during the audit mode phase, on the next reboot, the enforced mode base policy will be automatically deployed using a scheduled task that acts as a \"snapback guarantee\".</p> <p>Note</p> <p>This feature can also detect and create supplemental policy for Kernel protected files, such as the executables of games installed using Xbox app. Make sure you run the game while the base policy is deployed in Audit mode so that it can capture those executables.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>You can use both Signed and Unsigned App Control policies. The app will automatically detect the signing status of the policy that you select and prompt for any additional information required.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"AppControl%20Manager/Allow%20New%20Apps/#other-use-cases","title":"Other Use Cases","text":"<p>You can also use this page to create supplemental policies for every program you wish to deploy to your endpoints. For example, if your company needs to allow the employees to use 20 programs such as Photoshop, AutoDesk, Visual Studio etc., you can follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Prepare a clean VM (Virtual Machine such as Hyper-V) by installing the latest OS version on it and updating it. After update and restart of the guest OS in the VM, Install the AppControl Manager on it and shut it down. Now create a Hyper-V checkpoint. You will use this checkpoint to return back to this clean state later on.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use AppControl Manager to deploy a base policy such as <code>Allow Microsoft</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the <code>Allow New Apps</code> feature, select the base policy and enter the name of the program you wish to create a supplemental policy for.</p> </li> <li> <p>In <code>Step 2</code>, the Audit mode is enabled, so start installing your program. After installation is completed, run the program, use it a bit and close it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Browse for the installation directories of the installed program and go to <code>Step 3</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The AppControl Manager will begin redeploying the base policy in enforced mode and starts scanning the directories you selected and any audit events that were generated.</p> </li> <li> <p>The detected and captured data will be presented to you in 2 different pages. Review them, search through them and remove any of them that you don't want to be included in the supplemental policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you're done reviewing, create the supplemental policy and deploy it on the system. Use the FilePublisher level which will create maintainable supplemental policies and will use signature(s) of the signed files and hashes of the unsigned files.</p> </li> <li> <p>After the policy is deployed, try starting your program again and make sure it 100% works and all of its features are usable.</p> </li> <li> <p>If one of the files of the program still gets blocked, that means you didn't browse for the directory where that file is located or you didn't use the program's feature that would trigger audit logs to be generated for its files. AppControl Manager offers multiple features that you can use to generate supplemental policies and then merge them all into one. For example, you can create a supplemental policy just from the event logs. You can also easily and quickly expand the supplemental policy that you just created by adding new rules to it.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p>"},{"location":"AppControl%20Manager/Allow%20New%20Apps/#configuration-details","title":"Configuration Details","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Supplemental Policy Name: Enter the name for the Supplemental policy that will be created. Preferably use the name of the app you're trying to install so that you will be able to recognize the policy in System Information page easily.</p> </li> <li> <p>Browse for a Policy XML file: Use this button to browse for the path to the base policy file, or pick a policy from the Policies Library on the Sidebar.</p> </li> <li> <p>Log Size: Use this number box to increase or decrease the maximum capacity of the <code>Code Integrity/Operational</code> logs. The bigger the number, the more events will be captured without being overwritten.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scan Level: You can choose from different scan levels. Refer to this page for all the information about them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Browse for folders: Use this button in Step 2 to browse for the installation directories of the app(s) you installed. This will help improve the accuracy of the supplemental policy that will be created. If for some reason you cannot locate the installation directory of the app you installed, ensure you start the app after installation, use it as you normally would so that audit logs will be generated for all of its files and components.

They are designed to serve specific purposes, such as defining global constants, variables, utility functions, or methods that perform similar operations. Because a static class is meant to be a container for these static members, it cannot be instantiated. This means that you cannot create objects from a static class. Instead, all its members must be accessed using the class name itself.</p> <p>Non-static classes, on the other hand, are much more versatile. They can do everything a static class can do and offer many additional features. For example, non-static classes can be instantiated, meaning you can create objects from them. These objects can represent custom types, holding state and behavior specific to each instance. This allows you to create multiple objects from the same class, each with its own unique state and/or property.</p> <p>Non-static classes can contain both static and non-static members. Static members of a non-static class are shared among all instances and are accessed using the class name, just like in a static class. Instance members, however, belong to each specific object and are accessed through that object.</p> <p>To access static members in both static and non-static classes, you use the same syntax: <code>ClassName.Member</code>.

While it would be ideal if verifying a signature could conclusively indicate safety, the reality is far more nuanced and complex. A digital signature is an excellent preventive measure, but when it comes to exploiting or infiltrating high-value targets, numerous techniques exist to circumvent this layer of defense. Also, the security of a digital signature is only as strong as the integrity and vigilance of the individual responsible for safeguarding it.</p> <p>In recent years, many certificate authorities have implemented stricter policies requiring individuals requesting a code-signing certificate to store it within a Hardware Security Module (HSM). This specialized device provides an added layer of physical security for cryptographic keys. However, like any piece of hardware, an HSM can still be stolen, making the physical security of the device\u2014where it is stored, whether it's kept in a high-grade safe, and the security of the person's residence\u2014critical factors in preventing unauthorized access.</p> <p>Equally important is the security of the code-signing process itself. Does the certificate holder use a dedicated, isolated environment exclusively for signing? Is it meticulously maintained to be free from malware and potential compromises? Or do they insert the HSM into a system that also serves daily, multipurpose functions? In the latter scenario, where the same device is used for browsing the internet or downloading software, the risk of infection rises dramatically. A malware infection on this system could allow malicious software to access private keys from the HSM during the signing process, effectively bypassing the HSM's intended protection. From the outside, as users, we have no practical way to verify or scrutinize these practices. We are fundamentally in the dark about whether an organization or individual has taken rigorous precautions or if they are following minimal security protocols. This lack of transparency introduces an additional layer of risk; users are left trusting in a process they cannot observe or evaluate.</p> <p>Another vital aspect to consider is the trustworthiness of the individual applying for the certificate. If the applicant is a malicious actor, the signature itself becomes a tool for potential harm. Unfortunately, most certificate authorities issuing code-signing or Extended Validation (EV) certificates do not conduct extensive vetting of applicants. Factors such as an applicant's criminal history, associations, travel history, or broader trustworthiness are seldom, if ever, scrutinized. This lack of rigorous background checks leaves the door open for bad actors to obtain certificates under the guise of legitimacy, turning a critical security feature into a potential vulnerability.</p>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Rethinking%20Trust%20Advanced%20Security%20Measures%20for%20High-Stakes%20Systems/#application-control-for-business","title":"Application Control for Business","text":"<p>This article was created by me to address these vulnerabilities directly. Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) or Application Control for Business exists precisely for this reason\u2014it transforms the security paradigm for both attackers and defenders by embracing a real zero-trust approach. Zero trust removes assumptions from the equation, requiring that every executable be explicitly validated before being allowed to run.</p> <p>In environments with highly sensitive devices or workspaces, relying solely on certificate authorities to secure your systems can be dangerously misguided. Trusting that a certificate authority has conducted rigorous due diligence when issuing code-signing certificates is a risky assumption. App Control provides a critical alternative: it enables you to define your own standards of trust, rather than leaving the responsibility in the hands of external entities who may have different criteria for assessing reliability.</p> <p>Application Control is empowering. It places the control squarely in your hands, allowing you to determine precisely which files, applications, or processes are authorized to execute on your device. By leveraging this approach, you gain comprehensive oversight and a new level of security confidence, knowing that only files meeting your strict criteria are permitted to run. In an era where threats are increasingly sophisticated, this individualized control over your digital environment is not only prudent but essential.</p>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Rethinking%20Trust%20Advanced%20Security%20Measures%20for%20High-Stakes%20Systems/#administrator-privilege","title":"Administrator Privilege","text":"<p>Exercise extreme caution with programs granted administrator privileges on your system. The User Account Control (UAC) prompt that appears, requesting permission, is more than a minor screen\u2014it serves as a critical security checkpoint. If you inadvertently grant a malicious program administrator access, reversing the damage can be extraordinarily challenging.</p> <p>When administrator privileges are granted, the program gains more than a one-time permission; it can establish persistent access by embedding itself deeply into the system. Malicious programs can create \"hooks\", allowing them to access your device and resources on demand. They might configure scheduled tasks to ensure persistence, execute commands with SYSTEM-level privileges, modify registry keys to enable startup scripts, or establish Windows services to maintain their foothold.</p> <p>Take, for example, the legitimate use case of the Steam game client. Upon installation and initial launch, Steam requests administrator privileges to set up a necessary service that has very high privileges. Although it doesn't ask for elevated permissions again with subsequent launches, this is because it has created that service during the initial setup that allows it to run with elevated privileges even after restarts or shutdowns. While Steam's case is benign, malware can exploit the same mechanisms and others for far more harmful purposes, achieving ongoing control over your device.</p>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Rethinking%20Trust%20Advanced%20Security%20Measures%20for%20High-Stakes%20Systems/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>In conclusion, Digital signatures are a strong security standard for most use cases, but in high-risk, high-value environments, they are merely not enough.

For instance, since you are the only person who is going to use the Active Directory, you can even give `Full Control` permission to `Authenticated Users` group.  Alternatively, you can use the same administrator account that you are currently using on Windows Server, which exists by default in the Active Directory, to log into the other client computer. One can log into multiple computers with the same user account across an Active Directory domain. There is no limit by default to how many concurrent logins an active directory user can have.  Make sure the Windows Server and Windows client VMs both use the same Hyper-V Private Virtual switch network adapter. The VMs need to have static IP addresses on the same subnet in order to communicate with each other.  Go to Windows Settings =&gt; Network &amp; Internet =&gt; Ethernet =&gt; in \"IP Assignment\" select \"Edit\" =&gt; Set it to \"Manual\" =&gt; Toggle the IPv4 =&gt; in IP Address Enter `10.10.10.1` and in Subnet Mask enter `255.0.0.0`. Without configuring anything else, save it.  Use the Edit button for DNS server assignment, set it to Manual, toggle the IPv4 button and in the Preferred DNS field enter `127.0.0.1`. Save everything and exit settings.    Steps to perform on Client VM   Make sure the client VM is running the latest version of Windows, and it follows the same prerequisites explained above.  Go to Windows Settings =&gt; Network &amp; Internet =&gt; Ethernet =&gt; in \"IP Assignment\" select \"Edit\" =&gt; Set it to \"Manual\" =&gt; Toggle the IPv4 =&gt; in IP Address Enter `10.10.10.2` and in Subnet Mask enter `255.0.0.0`. Without configuring anything else, save it.  Now use the Edit button for DNS server assignment, set it to Manual, toggle the IPv4 button and in the Preferred DNS field enter the static IP address of the Windows Server VM, which was `10.10.10.1`. Save everything and exit settings.  Open an elevated PowerShell and enter this to join the Active Directory domain:  <pre><code>Add-Computer -DomainName &lt;Domain&gt; -Restart\n</code></pre>  You will be asked for credentials. If you are going to use the same Administrator account from Windows Server, use `Administrator` for username and enter the password of the Windows Server in the password field, otherwise use the password you set when creating the new user account in Active Directory Users and Computers.  After the client machine restarted, use `Other user` option on the lock screen and this time you will be using the Active Directory credentials to log into the machine. If using the built-in Administrator account, the password will be the same as the password on Windows Server account, but the username will be in the  format, so in this case, it will be `Administrator@CAServer.com`.  Since you are using Administrator account, you can by default use Enhanced session in Hyper-V too.

It eliminates the default open-ended approach where any file can be executed freely.

No unauthorized file or program\u2014no matter how cleverly disguised or insidiously crafted\u2014can execute without explicit consent.

An Administrator is a user with the highest level of access to the OS, possessing the authority to make system-wide changes that impact all users.</p> <p>Administrators are responsible for managing system security, modifying security settings, installing software and hardware, and accessing all files on the computer. Notably, an Administrator can seamlessly elevate privileges to SYSTEM, Managed Installer, or other access levels due to the absence of security boundaries between them. Equivalent roles in other operating systems include Root, SuperUser, and similar designations.</p> <p>Implementing an Application Control policy requires Administrator privileges. Without these elevated permissions, it is impossible to deploy, remove, or alter any App Control policies.</p> <p>Deploying an unsigned App Control policy leaves it vulnerable to removal or modification by any user with Administrator privileges. But what if you need your App Control policy to be so tamper-resistant that even an Administrator cannot alter or remove it? This is where signing comes into play.</p> <p>App Control policies, authored in XML format, must be converted into .cip binary files before deployment. To enhance security and ensure tamper resistance, the .cip file can be signed with a code signing certificate prior to deployment. This signing process effectively fortifies the policy, making it impervious to unauthorized modifications or removal.</p> <p>Signed App Control policies offer a formidable defense, they significantly hinder adversaries from achieving initial access to the system, a critical juncture in any attack. The importance of preventing initial access cannot be overstated. Once an attacker gains Administrator privileges, they inherently acquire the capability to manipulate the system.</p> <p>For example, although a signed App Control policy cannot be removed, an attacker with Administrator rights could still deploy a new policy designed to block essential Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) sensors or data collection agents. This could include tools like Azure Monitor Agent for Microsoft Sentinel or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, effectively disrupting telemetry and impeding security monitoring.</p> <p>Despite this potential for disruption, attackers are still constrained by the integrity of signed policies, which prohibit unauthorized programs from executing. Consequently, engineering robust defenses to prevent initial access, particularly access that elevates privileges to Administrator, remains paramount in securing modern systems.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"WDAC/The%20Strength%20of%20Signed%20App%20Control%20Policies/#system-behavior-after-deploying-a-signed-application-control-policy","title":"System Behavior After Deploying a Signed Application Control Policy","text":"<p>After a signed App Control policy .cip is copied to the EFI partition as part of the deployment process, we can see in System Information that Application Control User-Mode is being enforced and when you try to install an application not permitted by the deployed policy, it will be successfully blocked.</p> <p>At this point, a system restart is required.

Without securing these high-level access points, other security measures become secondary. These privileged roles are essential for any configurable system, as they enable the management and customization of hardware and security settings. However, there are consumer-level systems such as the Xbox Series X/S that do not have these highly-privileged accounts. These are designed as secure black boxes, not only to protect the user from malware but also to safeguard the hardware from user intervention, creating a vastly different threat model.</p> <p>In contrast, on conventional computer systems, root/administrator privileges are necessary to maintain control over system security. Threat actors recognize the value of gaining these privileges, as it allows them to manipulate system security to their advantage. However, with Windows' multi-layered security infrastructure, which integrates both hardware and software protections, we can effectively thwart these efforts. Each defense layer can be made increasingly difficult and time-consuming for attackers to bypass, creating an almost insurmountable challenge. As cyber threats continue to evolve and adversaries grow more sophisticated, systems must adapt to provide robust, tamper-resistant defenses described in this article.</p> <p></p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Continue reading:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Penetration Testing and Benchmarking</p> </li> <li> <p>Deploying Signed App Control policies</p> </li> <li> <p>Creating Code Signing Certificate via AppControl Manager</p> </li> <li> <p>Only a Small Portion of The Windows OS Security Apparatus</p> </li> <li> <p>RuntimeEncryption of Memory With Intel\u00ae Total Memory Encryption - Multi-Key</p> </li> <li> <p>TCG Storage Opal Integration Guidelines</p> </li> <li> <p>Trusted Computing Group and NVM Express Joint White Paper: TCG Storage, Opal, and NVMe</p> </li> <li> <p>All other TCG articles related to OPAL</p> </li> <li> <p>An example of a CPU supporting Total Memory Encryption - Multi Key - Intel 14700k</p> </li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"WDAC/WDAC%20Notes/","title":"Important Notes and Tips about App Control policies","text":""},{"location":"WDAC/WDAC%20Notes/#important-notes-and-tips-about-app-control-policies","title":"Important Notes and Tips about App Control policies","text":"<ul> <li>App Control for Business was formerly known as WDAC (Windows Defender Application Control)</li> <li>It's used for Application and File whitelisting in Windows.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"WDAC/WDAC%20Notes/#supplemental-app-control-policy-considerations","title":"Supplemental App Control Policy Considerations","text":""},{"location":"WDAC/WDAC%20Notes/#verify-policy-type","title":"Verify Policy type","text":"<p>We have to make sure the App Control policy that we are going to use as a supplemental policy has <code>PolicyType=\"Supplemental Policy\"</code> in the <code>SiPolicy</code> element of the XML file.
