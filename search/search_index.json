They are designed to serve specific purposes, such as defining global constants, variables, utility functions, or methods that perform similar operations. Because a static class is meant to be a container for these static members, it cannot be instantiated. This means that you cannot create objects from a static class. Instead, all its members must be accessed using the class name itself.</p> <p>Non-static classes, on the other hand, are much more versatile. They can do everything a static class can do and offer many additional features. For example, non-static classes can be instantiated, meaning you can create objects from them. These objects can represent custom types, holding state and behavior specific to each instance. This allows you to create multiple objects from the same class, each with its own unique state and/or property.</p> <p>Non-static classes can contain both static and non-static members. Static members of a non-static class are shared among all instances and are accessed using the class name, just like in a static class. Instance members, however, belong to each specific object and are accessed through that object.</p> <p>To access static members in both static and non-static classes, you use the same syntax: <code>ClassName.Member</code>.

While it would be ideal if verifying a signature could conclusively indicate safety, the reality is far more nuanced and complex. A digital signature is an excellent preventive measure, but when it comes to exploiting or infiltrating high-value targets, numerous techniques exist to circumvent this layer of defense. Also, the security of a digital signature is only as strong as the integrity and vigilance of the individual responsible for safeguarding it.</p> <p>In recent years, many certificate authorities have implemented stricter policies requiring individuals requesting a code-signing certificate to store it within a Hardware Security Module (HSM). This specialized device provides an added layer of physical security for cryptographic keys. However, like any piece of hardware, an HSM can still be stolen, making the physical security of the device\u2014where it is stored, whether it's kept in a high-grade safe, and the security of the person's residence\u2014critical factors in preventing unauthorized access.</p> <p>Equally important is the security of the code-signing process itself. Does the certificate holder use a dedicated, isolated environment exclusively for signing? Is it meticulously maintained to be free from malware and potential compromises? Or do they insert the HSM into a system that also serves daily, multipurpose functions? In the latter scenario, where the same device is used for browsing the internet or downloading software, the risk of infection rises dramatically. A malware infection on this system could allow malicious software to access private keys from the HSM during the signing process, effectively bypassing the HSM's intended protection. From the outside, as users, we have no practical way to verify or scrutinize these practices. We are fundamentally in the dark about whether an organization or individual has taken rigorous precautions or if they are following minimal security protocols. This lack of transparency introduces an additional layer of risk; users are left trusting in a process they cannot observe or evaluate.</p> <p>Another vital aspect to consider is the trustworthiness of the individual applying for the certificate. If the applicant is a malicious actor, the signature itself becomes a tool for potential harm. Unfortunately, most certificate authorities issuing code-signing or Extended Validation (EV) certificates do not conduct extensive vetting of applicants. Factors such as an applicant's criminal history, associations, travel history, or broader trustworthiness are seldom, if ever, scrutinized. This lack of rigorous background checks leaves the door open for bad actors to obtain certificates under the guise of legitimacy, turning a critical security feature into a potential vulnerability.</p>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Rethinking%20Trust%20Advanced%20Security%20Measures%20for%20High-Stakes%20Systems/#application-control-for-business","title":"Application Control for Business","text":"<p>This article was created by me to address these vulnerabilities directly. Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) or Application Control for Business exists precisely for this reason\u2014it transforms the security paradigm for both attackers and defenders by embracing a real zero-trust approach. Zero trust removes assumptions from the equation, requiring that every executable be explicitly validated before being allowed to run.</p> <p>In environments with highly sensitive devices or workspaces, relying solely on certificate authorities to secure your systems can be dangerously misguided. Trusting that a certificate authority has conducted rigorous due diligence when issuing code-signing certificates is a risky assumption. App Control provides a critical alternative: it enables you to define your own standards of trust, rather than leaving the responsibility in the hands of external entities who may have different criteria for assessing reliability.</p> <p>Application Control is empowering. It places the control squarely in your hands, allowing you to determine precisely which files, applications, or processes are authorized to execute on your device. By leveraging this approach, you gain comprehensive oversight and a new level of security confidence, knowing that only files meeting your strict criteria are permitted to run. In an era where threats are increasingly sophisticated, this individualized control over your digital environment is not only prudent but essential.</p>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Rethinking%20Trust%20Advanced%20Security%20Measures%20for%20High-Stakes%20Systems/#administrator-privilege","title":"Administrator Privilege","text":"<p>Exercise extreme caution with programs granted administrator privileges on your system. The User Account Control (UAC) prompt that appears, requesting permission, is more than a minor screen\u2014it serves as a critical security checkpoint. If you inadvertently grant a malicious program administrator access, reversing the damage can be extraordinarily challenging.</p> <p>When administrator privileges are granted, the program gains more than a one-time permission; it can establish persistent access by embedding itself deeply into the system. Malicious programs can create \"hooks\", allowing them to access your device and resources on demand. They might configure scheduled tasks to ensure persistence, execute commands with SYSTEM-level privileges, modify registry keys to enable startup scripts, or establish Windows services to maintain their foothold.</p> <p>Take, for example, the legitimate use case of the Steam game client. Upon installation and initial launch, Steam requests administrator privileges to set up a necessary service that has very high privileges. Although it doesn't ask for elevated permissions again with subsequent launches, this is because it has created that service during the initial setup that allows it to run with elevated privileges even after restarts or shutdowns. While Steam's case is benign, malware can exploit the same mechanisms and others for far more harmful purposes, achieving ongoing control over your device.</p>"},{"location":"Miscellaneous/Rethinking%20Trust%20Advanced%20Security%20Measures%20for%20High-Stakes%20Systems/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>In conclusion, Digital signatures are a strong security standard for most use cases, but in high-risk, high-value environments, they are merely not enough.

For instance, since you are the only person who is going to use the Active Directory, you can even give `Full Control` permission to `Authenticated Users` group.  Alternatively, you can use the same administrator account that you are currently using on Windows Server, which exists by default in the Active Directory, to log into the other client computer. One can log into multiple computers with the same user account across an Active Directory domain. There is no limit by default to how many concurrent logins an active directory user can have.  Make sure the Windows Server and Windows client VMs both use the same Hyper-V Private Virtual switch network adapter. The VMs need to have static IP addresses on the same subnet in order to communicate with each other.  Go to Windows Settings =&gt; Network &amp; Internet =&gt; Ethernet =&gt; in \"IP Assignment\" select \"Edit\" =&gt; Set it to \"Manual\" =&gt; Toggle the IPv4 =&gt; in IP Address Enter `10.10.10.1` and in Subnet Mask enter `255.0.0.0`. Without configuring anything else, save it.  Use the Edit button for DNS server assignment, set it to Manual, toggle the IPv4 button and in the Preferred DNS field enter `127.0.0.1`. Save everything and exit settings.    Steps to perform on Client VM   Make sure the client VM is running the latest version of Windows, and it follows the same prerequisites explained above.  Go to Windows Settings =&gt; Network &amp; Internet =&gt; Ethernet =&gt; in \"IP Assignment\" select \"Edit\" =&gt; Set it to \"Manual\" =&gt; Toggle the IPv4 =&gt; in IP Address Enter `10.10.10.2` and in Subnet Mask enter `255.0.0.0`. Without configuring anything else, save it.  Now use the Edit button for DNS server assignment, set it to Manual, toggle the IPv4 button and in the Preferred DNS field enter the static IP address of the Windows Server VM, which was `10.10.10.1`. Save everything and exit settings.  Open an elevated PowerShell and enter this to join the Active Directory domain:  <pre><code>Add-Computer -DomainName &lt;Domain&gt; -Restart\n</code></pre>  You will be asked for credentials. If you are going to use the same Administrator account from Windows Server, use `Administrator` for username and enter the password of the Windows Server in the password field, otherwise use the password you set when creating the new user account in Active Directory Users and Computers.  After the client machine restarted, use `Other user` option on the lock screen and this time you will be using the Active Directory credentials to log into the machine. If using the built-in Administrator account, the password will be the same as the password on Windows Server account, but the username will be in the  format, so in this case, it will be `Administrator@CAServer.com`.  Since you are using Administrator account, you can by default use Enhanced session in Hyper-V too.

It eliminates the default open-ended approach where any file can be executed freely. Instead, you define a policy\u2014formatted as an XML file\u2014that specifies which certificates or files are trusted. The system then enforces this policy, permitting only the approved files and programs to run while blocking everything else.</p> <p>This fundamentally changes the security landscape.

An Administrator is a user with the highest level of access to the OS, possessing the authority to make system-wide changes that impact all users.</p> <p>Administrators are responsible for managing system security, modifying security settings, installing software and hardware, and accessing all files on the computer. Notably, an Administrator can seamlessly elevate privileges to SYSTEM, Managed Installer, or other access levels due to the absence of security boundaries between them. Equivalent roles in other operating systems include Root, SuperUser, and similar designations.</p> <p>Implementing an Application Control policy requires Administrator privileges. Without these elevated permissions, it is impossible to deploy, remove, or alter any App Control policies.</p> <p>Deploying an unsigned App Control policy leaves it vulnerable to removal or modification by any user with Administrator privileges. But what if you need your App Control policy to be so tamper-resistant that even an Administrator cannot alter or remove it? This is where signing comes into play.</p> <p>App Control policies, authored in XML format, must be converted into .cip binary files before deployment. To enhance security and ensure tamper resistance, the .cip file can be signed with a code signing certificate prior to deployment. This signing process effectively fortifies the policy, making it impervious to unauthorized modifications or removal.</p> <p>Signed App Control policies offer a formidable defense, they significantly hinder adversaries from achieving initial access to the system, a critical juncture in any attack. The importance of preventing initial access cannot be overstated. Once an attacker gains Administrator privileges, they inherently acquire the capability to manipulate the system.</p> <p>For example, although a signed App Control policy cannot be removed, an attacker with Administrator rights could still deploy a new policy designed to block essential Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) sensors or data collection agents. This could include tools like Azure Monitor Agent for Microsoft Sentinel or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, effectively disrupting telemetry and impeding security monitoring.</p> <p>Despite this potential for disruption, attackers are still constrained by the integrity of signed policies, which prohibit unauthorized programs from executing. Consequently, engineering robust defenses to prevent initial access, particularly access that elevates privileges to Administrator, remains paramount in securing modern systems.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"WDAC/The%20Strength%20of%20Signed%20App%20Control%20Policies/#system-behavior-after-deploying-a-signed-application-control-policy","title":"System Behavior After Deploying a Signed Application Control Policy","text":"<p>After a signed App Control policy .cip is copied to the EFI partition as part of the deployment process, we can see in System Information that Application Control User-Mode is being enforced and when you try to install an application not permitted by the deployed policy, it will be successfully blocked.</p> <p>At this point, a system restart is required.

This type of attack, also known as an in-memory attack, is a serious concern, as data such as encryption keys or authentication credentials may reside in RAM while the system is active. However, modern CPUs have built-in Total Memory Encryption (TME) capabilities to mitigate this risk. TME encrypts the contents of memory at runtime using industry-standard AES-XTS algorithms, as defined by NIST, ensuring that all data stored in RAM is encrypted while the system is running, providing data protection in transit just like what TLS does for network connections.

Additionally, this action breaks the compatibility between Secure Boot, TPM, and BitLocker's TPM key protector, causing BitLocker to prompt for the 48-character recovery password 10 Reconnecting the SED to another (incompatible) device The drive won't be recognized, either during boot or within the OS (whether Windows or Linux) 10 Reconnecting the SED to another (compatible) device Requires the TCG Storage Password (PBA) for authentication 10 Attempting to reset the UEFI password via CMOS reset or external buttons This action breaks the trust between TPM and BitLocker key protectors, causing BitLocker to prompt for the 48-character recovery password. The TCG Storage Password (PBA) remains unaffected and still required 10 Attempting to modify UEFI settings, such as disabling Secure Boot, TPM, or any other configuration UEFI settings can be set to Read-Only due to the deployment of the signed App Control policy, preventing changes even after multiple reboots 10 Attempting BitLocker pre-boot authentication Requires triple-factor authentication: Pre-boot PIN, TPM, and a security key on a USB drive 10 Booting a live OS from USB and attempting to remove the Signed App Control policy by deleting/formatting the EFI partition or removing the individual CIP file While the policy will be removed and App Control disabled, the attacker must still bypass BitLocker. The EFI partition is not encrypted by BitLocker but is protected by TCG OPAL encryption, which is assumed to have been bypassed at this point in chart. This action also triggers BitLocker to prompt for the 48-character recovery password due to Secure Boot 10 Trying to guess the PIN Activates the TPM's anti-hammering mechanism, causing each subsequent failed PIN attempt to experience progressively longer delays, as the TPM enforces increasing time intervals between attempts (which is only 1 part of the triple authentication) 9 Attacker attempts to exfiltrate data from non-OS drives Each drive is BitLocker-encrypted and requires a unique 48-character recovery password to access 8 After bypassing all previous protections and layers, attacker reaches the Windows lock screen Additional anti-hammering features and policies, implemented through the Harden Windows Security project, limit incorrect PIN attempts to three within a 24-hour period. A fourth failed attempt within this timeframe triggers a total lockdown, requiring the 48-character BitLocker recovery password to regain access 8 Attacker attempts to perform an administrative task No local administrator account exists; the device is managed remotely via Microsoft Entra ID, and the local user only has Standard privileges 8 Attacker attempts to run unauthorized software Blocked by the Signed App Control policy (Unless the policy was removed previously from the EFI partition) 9 Attacker attempts to execute any type of malware early in the boot process Blocked by the Signed App Control policy, which executes earlier in the boot sequence (Unless the policy was removed previously from the EFI partition) 9 Attacker attempts to remove the signed app control policy Makes the OS unbootable (Unless the policy was removed previously from the EFI partition) <p></p>"},{"location":"WDAC/The%20Strength%20of%20Signed%20App%20Control%20Policies/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>The protection of initial access and root/superuser/administrator privileges is fundamental to system security. Without securing these high-level access points, other security measures become secondary. These privileged roles are essential for any configurable system, as they enable the management and customization of hardware and security settings. However, there are consumer-level systems such as the Xbox Series X/S that do not have these highly-privileged accounts. These are designed as secure black boxes, not only to protect the user from malware but also to safeguard the hardware from user intervention, creating a vastly different threat model.</p> <p>In contrast, on conventional computer systems, root/administrator privileges are necessary to maintain control over system security. Threat actors recognize the value of gaining these privileges, as it allows them to manipulate system security to their advantage. However, with Windows' multi-layered security infrastructure, which integrates both hardware and software protections, we can effectively thwart these efforts. Each defense layer can be made increasingly difficult and time-consuming for attackers to bypass, creating an almost insurmountable challenge.

Also, not all drivers are Kernel mode, there are user-mode drivers too.</p> <p>This strict Kernel mode policy can be perfectly deployed side by side any other App Control policy.</p> <p>For instance, since HVCI is turned on by default on my system, the Microsoft Recommended driver block rules is automatically deployed and it's only Kernel mode. It has 2 allow all rules, making it primarily a block-list policy.</p> <p>Then I deploy Strict Kernel-mode App Control policy, which also only applies to Kernel-mode drivers. It doesn't have allow all rules of course, instead it allows Windows components that are required for Windows to function properly to run and then will let you hand pick any 3rd party Kernel-mode drivers and easily allow them in your policy.</p> <p>Now the Allow all rules that exist in the first policy are neutralized.
